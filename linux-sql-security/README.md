## 📌 Objective  
Practice Linux system and SQL database security by setting up a local environment, identifying vulnerabilities, and applying remediation measures. This project helps build foundational skills in **Linux administration, database security, and secure configurations**.

---

## 🛠️ Methodology  

1. **Environment Setup:**  
   - Installed a Linux virtual machine (Ubuntu) using **VirtualBox**.  
   - Installed **MySQL** and created a test database for practice.  

2. **Vulnerability Testing:**  
   - Configured multiple MySQL user accounts with different privileges.  
   - Tested for weak credentials and attempted **SQL injection** in a safe, local environment.  
   - Checked for misconfigured permissions and unnecessary root access.  

3. **Remediation Steps:**  
   - Hardened MySQL user accounts by enforcing **strong passwords** and **least privilege** access.  
   - Updated Linux packages and applied **firewall rules** to limit database exposure.  
   - Documented configuration changes and verified security improvements through test queries.  

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes  

- Identified insecure MySQL user accounts and corrected permissions.  
- Practiced **SQL injection prevention techniques** in a controlled environment.  
- Improved Linux system security by applying updates, firewall rules, and proper database configurations.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  

- **Linux (Ubuntu)** – System setup and administration  
- **MySQL** – Local database setup and testing  
- **VirtualBox** – Virtual machine environment  
- **Nmap / netstat** – Optional for checking open ports and services  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways  

- Linux and SQL configurations can easily be exploited if left unprotected.  
- Practicing secure configurations in a **sandbox environment** is safe and educational.  
- Fundamental skills in Linux administration and database security are critical for cybersecurity analysts.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps / Future Improvements  

- Explore more advanced SQL security concepts like **stored procedure security** and **role-based access control**.  
- Implement **automated security auditing scripts** for Linux and MySQL.  
- Integrate this practice with **web applications** to simulate real-world attack scenarios safely.

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)  

- Include screenshots of MySQL users, permissions, firewall rules, or test queries to visually demonstrate your work.
