## 📌 Objective  
Simulate how suspicious files might behave in a safe environment by monitoring file system changes.  

⚠️ **Note:** This project is for educational purposes only. Use safe test files — never real malware.  

---  

## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. **Baseline Capture:**  
   - Recorded files in the working directory before execution.  

2. **File Execution:**  
   - Ran a test Python script with a time limit.  

3. **Post-Execution Analysis:**  
   - Compared files before and after to detect new or modified files.  
   - Reported findings in terminal output.  

---  

## 📊 Key Outcomes  
- Simulated malware behavior safely.  
- Practiced **process monitoring and file I/O**.  
- Learned investigation methods used by malware analysts.  

---  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** – Process monitoring  
- **Subprocess Library** – Controlled execution  
- **OS Library** – File system analysis  

---  

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
- Malware often creates or modifies files.  
- Sandboxes give analysts visibility into behavior.  
- Safe simulations help beginners understand threats without risk.  

---  

## 🚀 Next Steps / Future Improvements  
- Add **network monitoring simulation**.  
- Visualize behavior with graphs.  
- Expand reporting into **JSON/CSV logs**.
