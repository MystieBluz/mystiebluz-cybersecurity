## 📌 Objective  
Identify open ports and common services on a target host using Python sockets.  

---  

## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. **Target Input:**  
   - Accepted an IP address as input.  

2. **Port Scanning:**  
   - Scanned ports in range 1–1024.  
   - Checked if connections succeeded.  

3. **Service Identification:**  
   - Mapped open ports to known services (e.g., 22 = SSH, 80 = HTTP).  

---  

## 📊 Key Outcomes  
- Detected open ports and running services.  
- Practiced **socket programming and networking basics**.  
- Built a foundation for advanced scanning tools like Nmap.  

---  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** – Sockets and networking  
- **Socket Library** – Service detection  

---  

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
- Open ports expose services to potential attackers.  
- Reconnaissance is the first step in penetration testing.  
- Writing your own scanner reinforces how Nmap works under the hood.  

---  

## 🚀 Next Steps / Future Improvements  
- Add **multi-threading** for faster scanning.  
- Expand scan to include **top 10,000 ports**.  
- Save results to a file or database.
