# 🔐 Cybersecurity Portfolio  

Welcome! 👋 I’m building my career in **Cybersecurity Analysis**, and this portfolio showcases hands-on projects where I practice **network security, log monitoring, and web application security**.  

Each project is documented like a professional case study — with objectives, methodology, findings, and key takeaways — so you can see both my **technical skills** and **problem-solving approach**.
