# 🔐 Cybersecurity Portfolio  

Welcome! 👋 I’m building my career in **Cybersecurity Analysis** and this portfolio highlights my hands-on projects where I practice security fundamentals, monitoring, and risk management.  

Each project is documented like a professional case study — with objectives, methodology, results, and key takeaways. This way, you can see not just the tools I used, but also **how I think and solve problems** like a security analyst.
