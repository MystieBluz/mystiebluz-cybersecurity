# 🔐 Cybersecurity Portfolio  

Welcome! 👋 I’m building my career in **Cybersecurity Analysis**, and this portfolio showcases hands-on projects where I practice **network security, log monitoring, and web application security**.  

Each project is documented like a professional case study — with objectives, methodology, findings, and key takeaways — so you can see both my **technical skills** and **problem-solving approach**.

![Beginner Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Beginner-blue)
![In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-orange)
![Portfolio Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Portfolio-Yes-purple)
![CompTIA Security+ Practice](https://img.shields.io/badge/CompTIA%20Security+-Practice-yellow)

- Conducted a vulnerability assessment of a home Wi-Fi network (subnet `192.168.1.0/24`) targeting the main router (`192.168.1.254`) and connected devices using **Nmap**, documenting open ports and risky services.  
- Applied security improvements: upgraded Wi-Fi encryption to **WPA3**, disabled WPS/UPnP, updated firmware, changed default/admin passwords, enabled firewall rules, and segmented IoT devices.  
- Validated improvements through post-hardening scans, reducing the attack surface by ~70% and confirming only essential services remained accessible.  

### 📊 [Security Log Analysis & SIEM Simulation](./siem-log-analysis/README.md)  
- Collected Windows logs and ingested them into **Splunk Free**.  
- Detected suspicious login behavior (simulated brute-force attacks) with custom dashboards and alerts.  
- Gained hands-on experience in **log analysis, SIEM dashboards, and incident response** workflows.  

### 🌐 [Secure Web Application Walkthrough (OWASP Top 10 Lite)](./owasp-web-app/README.md)  
- Explored vulnerabilities in **OWASP Juice Shop**, including SQL Injection and XSS.  
- Demonstrated safe proof-of-concepts and recommended developer-friendly remediations.  
- Built a practical understanding of secure coding practices aligned with OWASP Top 10.
